# Decentralized Entertainment Releasing Protocol
(DerpTube)


## Introduction

A protocol for sharing media content where the "presenting" service and the "hosting" service are decoupled, yet joined by a decentralized network. It allows the content to be hosted on any server the content creator chooses and presented on any "presenting" website that is part of the network, while each party still retains access control. The goal is to offer content creators a way to generate revenue via established and well marketed media browsing websites ("presenting" services), while giving these services a way to generate revenue through the presentation of these video's without having the expenses of hosting them.
